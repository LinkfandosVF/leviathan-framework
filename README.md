# Leviathan Framework
A functional mod example and framework for Cryptid Crush. (Coming soon)


Welcome human!

This github repository will allow you to learn about, and perhaps create, mods for the TTRPG Cryptid Crush! Exiting isn't it? Heh.

All you need is a computer, and a lot of time.

This project is very work in progress, and is completely based on my lost hours of free time. So don't expect too much support or anything.


## Quick explanation (i'll change later)

- You fork
- You edit stuff and open with renpy
- you upload
- people put this in their game files and build with renpy
- modded


There's 3 categories of mods:

- First Class (Texture changes for example) Installed first
- Second class (Script change for example) Are installed after
- Third class (Major script change for example) are installed last

Note that you should ALWAYS choose to replace files when doing so.
